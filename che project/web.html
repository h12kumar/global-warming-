			<h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
			<p>Global warming is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature to rise.</p>
			<p>The burning of coal, oil, and gas for energy is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Other activities that contribute to global warming include agriculture, transportation, and industrial processes.</p>

		<section id="effects">
			<h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
			<p>Global warming is causing a range of negative effects, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rising sea levels due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets</li>
				<li>More frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires</li>
				<li>Increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods</li>
				<li>Loss of biodiversity and habitats due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These effects have significant impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the economy.</p>

		<section id="solutions">
			<h2>Solutions to Global Warming</h2>
			<p>To address global warming, we need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy. Some key solutions include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power</li>
				<li>Promoting energy efficiency and conservation</li>
				<li>Reducing waste and consumption, and promoting circular economy practices</li>
				<li>Protecting and restoring ecosystems, such as forests and wetlands, which can store carbon and help mitigate climate change</li>
				<li>Adapting to the impacts of global warming, such as building sea walls to protect against rising sea levels and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Individuals can also take action to reduce their carbon footprint by making lifestyle changes such as driving less, eating a plant-based diet, and reducing energy consumption in their homes.</p>
