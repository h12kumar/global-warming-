	<h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
	<p>The primary cause of global warming is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase is largely due to human activities, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy</li>
		<li>Deforestation and land use changes, which reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that trees can absorb from the atmosphere</li>
		<li>Industrial processes, such as cement production, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide</li>
		<li>Waste production, particularly the decomposition of organic waste in landfills which releases methane, another potent greenhouse gas</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Other Causes</h2>
	<p>While greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming, there are other factors that contribute to the problem. These include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increased livestock production and the associated emissions of methane and nitrous oxide</li>
		<li>Transportation emissions, such as those from cars, trucks, and airplanes</li>
		<li>Industrial and agricultural processes that release other greenhouse gases like fluorinated gases and nitrous oxide</li>
		<li>Natural factors, such as changes in the sun's energy output and volcanic eruptions, although these are much less significant than human activities</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>By understanding the causes of global warming, we can take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down the rate of global warming. This includes transitioning to cleaner forms of energy, reducing waste and consumption, and supporting sustainable practices in industries like agriculture and transportation.</p>
