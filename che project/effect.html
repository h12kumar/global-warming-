	<h2>Rising Temperatures</h2>
	<p>Global warming has led to an increase in average global temperatures, which in turn has caused numerous negative impacts. Higher temperatures are contributing to more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. This can lead to crop failures, food shortages, and water scarcity in many parts of the world.</p>
	
	<h2>Sea Level Rise</h2>
	<p>As global temperatures rise, the polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate. This is causing sea levels to rise, which can lead to flooding in coastal areas. Sea level rise can also contaminate fresh water supplies with salt water, which can further exacerbate water scarcity issues.</p>
	
	<h2>Extreme Weather Events</h2>
	<p>Global warming is also causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, cyclones, and tornadoes. These events can cause widespread damage and destruction, and they can also lead to loss of life.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The effects of global warming are widespread and far-reaching, and they have the potential to cause significant harm to human societies and the natural world. It is important that we take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change before it is too late.</p>
